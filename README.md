# Stock Analysis

## Overview
<What was the purpose of this analysis?>
The first purpose of this analysis was to enable the viewer to quickly observe two key indicators  of performance for 12 companies that are publicly traded in the US stock market. The first indicator was "total volume," which reflected the total number of trade transactions that a given company's stock underwent in one of the two years for which there was data (2017 and 2018). The second indicator was "return," which describes a stock's return in a given year.

The second purpose of this analysis was to refactor code that, though functional, included a nested loop that made the run-time needlessly lengthy.

## Results
<Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution time of the original script and the refactored script>

### Comparing Yearly Yields
Stock trade volumes and yields varied greatly between 2017 and 2018, as the comparison chart below demonstrates.
